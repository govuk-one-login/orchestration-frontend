### Manual creation of ECR

As the dev environment is being deployed into the gds-di-development account at the moment. There already
exists a container image repository generated by the dev-platform stack. As the dev and build images should be held
seperately, a manual ecr is created, copying over the configuration from the dev-platform generated container image
repostitory.

This won't be releveant once we start deploying the dev environemnt in its own account.
